# 1. Project Title
Franchise Connect Platform by Senan Otsuka 

# 2. Project Overview

Many Japanese restaurant owners have a positive attitude towards franchising and would do so given the opportunity. There is demand from foreign investors to franchise Japanese restaurants. However, only the large corporations who have an abundance of capital and power are currently franchising abroad. This platform gives the opportunity for smaller Japanese businesses and foreign investors to connect while being provided professional insight from experts who have experience in the franchising industry. Further, investors are able to begin a Japanese restaurant with a pre- established brand, instead of having to start from the beginning

# 4. ISBA Subfields
The ISBA subfields that applied to this project were application development, IT project management, and business analytics. 

## Application Development 
Application development has been a cornerstone of this project, beginning with the creation of a website as a primary application. The process started with gathering information and developing flowcharts to outline the required functionalities and capabilities, providing a clear roadmap for the website’s design and features. This structured approach ensured alignment with project goals from the initial stages through testing and deployment. Utilizing JIRA for project management and organizing development stages into sprint goals allowed for efficient tracking and iterative progress. CRUD operations were integrated and tested throughout various stages of the project to ensure robust functionality, particularly for features like managing user profiles, handling data submissions, and maintaining database integrity. By focusing on these core principles, I was able to deliver a website that was not only fully functional and user-focused but also scalable and reliable, meeting the diverse needs of its users. 

## IT Project Management

IT project management was a critical component of this project, facilitated through the use of the no-code application development platform, Bubble. The process began with meticulous planning of user flows for both investors and restaurant owners to ensure the platform met their needs effectively. This step involved mapping out functionalities and capabilities, such as account management, seamless user interfaces, and visualization, to guide the platform's design and development. As the project progressed, I engaged in continuous iterations to update and enhance the website based on testing and seeding the website with fake data, ensuring a high-quality final product.

To manage the project effectively, I utilized JIRA as a central tool for organizing tasks and tracking progress. The workflow was divided into two-week sprints, during which specific issues and challenges were addressed methodically. This iterative approach allowed for the identification and resolution of technical problems and the consistent improvement of platform features. By implementing structured IT project management, I successfully developed a user-focused, functional website that aligned with the project’s goals and stakeholders' expectations. Further, since this website is still at a foundational stage which serves as a minimal viable product, IT project management allows me to identify points that I can continue to enhance and improve. 

## Business Analytics 
Business analytics played a pivotal role in the success of the Franchise Connect platform, guiding the project through its various stages. At the outset, I conducted extensive research on successful franchises in Japan, gathering quantitative data to understand key factors contributing to their success. This included market trends and customer preferences, providing a solid foundation for the platform's development. Additionally, competitive analysis allowed me to identify gaps and opportunities in the existing market, ensuring the website would offer unique and valuable features.

Beyond quantitative data, qualitative research was equally important. By conducting surveys and interviews with Japanese restaurant owners, I gained critical insights into their needs and challenges. This research revealed essential services and functionalities that needed to be incorporated into the platform, such as tools for managing franchise applications, communication, and performance tracking. By leveraging business analytics to synthesize data from multiple sources, I was able to design a user-focused, data-driven website that effectively addresses the demands of both franchisors and franchisees, ensuring its relevance and success in the competitive market.

# 7. Next Steps / Future Improvements
One feature I wanted to implement on the website was an instant chat feature in which the investor could message the franchisee directly through our website. By doing this, we are able to create more user reliance on our website while having a more proprietary feature. Further, this would allow for a more seamless user experience for both our investor and franchisee as they would have one universal platform where they could connect.
